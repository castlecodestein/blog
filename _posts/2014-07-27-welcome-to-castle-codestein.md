Hello, I'm Tomasz Krug and you have just stumbled upon my Java oriented blog.

I've been using a vast array of other languages over the past years including C#, C++, Javascript, PL/SQL, PHP and VBA but Java is the one that I'm most familiar with and the one I just love developing with. As you can see I'm more of a backend guy. While some posts on frontend issues can appear it is not a top priority.

The main goal of this blog is to keep track of all the problems I encountered and all the technologies I used. It is to be a repository of quick start posts and neat solutions. Most of the time the post's topic will be related to a part of the Java ecosystem. Most of the time it will be backed by a project freely available on Github or at least by a dozen of small code samples.

Hope you will some useful information here and if anything is not clear please let me know in the comments.

Have a nice day!
